  <h1>"use restrict"; // restrict mode for JavaScript</h1>
<p>Restrict mode for JavaScript (ECMAScript) is a proper subset of the
  language. Conform to it and enjoy more robust programs.

<p>Restrict mode is simple to learn. The rules are:

<ol start="0">
<li> <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code><br> are already strict by
  default, with identical semantics in restrict mode. Use them!
<small><a id="a0" href="#a">click for why?</a></small><div id="div0">Because <code>===</code>
    and <code>!==</code> are consistent, you'll remember their
    semantics, and most of the time they're exactly what you
    wanted. The loose <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators
    are quite complex and their semantics are not very consistent. The
    use of the built-in strict operators seem to be common practice
    today. It's a pity there's just two of them. But we're fixing that
    now.</div><br>

<li><code>==</code> and <code>!=</code><br> are restricted to 
  <code>undefined == null (true)</code> and <code>undefined !=
    null (false)</code>. They are otherwise only allowed when
    the <code>===</code> or <code>!==</code> operator yields an
    identical result
<small><a id="a1" href="#a">click for why?</a></small><div id="div1">Because many otherwise
    well-written programs rely on the behaviour that a declared but
    not initialized variable (or a non-existing property) <code>==
    null</code>. You are strongly encouraged to avoid the use
    of <code>==</code> and
    <code>!=</code>. Initialize to <code>null</code> or
    compare using <code>=== undefined</code> instead. Restrict
    <i>pedantic</i> mode disallows <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>
    entirely, except when @loose-annotated.
</div><br>

<li> <code>+ < <= >= ></code><br> are restricted to primitive <code>strings</code> or <code>numbers</code> (but never a mix)
<small><a id="a2" href="#a">click for why?</a></small><div id="div2">Because type coercion
    for <code>+</code> is such a common source of bugs. <code>a + b</code> either adds
    <code>numbers</code> or concatenates <code>strings</code>. Use
    the <code>String()</code> or <code>Number()</code> functions
    (without <code>new</code>) to type-convert explicitly, when you
    must. For <code>string</code> formatting, you're often better off
    using <code><a href="https://github.com/olov/jsshaper/blob/master/src/fmt.js">Fmt()</a></code>
    or something similar.

    Because <code>< >= >= ></code> either compares <code>numbers</code> or <code>strings</code>
    (lexically). Mixing these types yields unrobust programs. Relying
    on automatic coersion from other types may surprise you.<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Most languages that support comparing of arrays does so
        element-wise. JS coerces into strings, which often is
        not what you want. <code>[1] < [2]</code>, <code>[1,2] < [1,3]</code>, but <code>[10]
        < [2]</code> (coerced into <code>"10" < "2"</code>)
      <li>JS has primitive and boxed types, with inconsistent
        semantics. <br><code>var x = new Number(3), y = new Number(3); x
        <= y, x >= y, 3 == x, 3 == y, but x != y</code>. The first comparisions coerces
      to primitives, the last compares object identity.
      <li><code>Date</code> is not funny: <code>(new Date()) + 1 === "Tue Dec 28 2010 23:59:53 GMT+0100 (CET)1"</code> but
        <code>(new Date()) - 1 === 1293577193075</code>. It coerces
        to <code>string</code> or <code>number</code> depending on
        operator. When a timestamp suffers, <code>Date.now()</code>
        should be used.
      <li>Since JS coerces <code>strings</code>
        into <code>numbers</code>, you get away with mistakenly
        mixing them. Robustness, performance and
        readability suffers. Combined with the design of
        the <code>+</code> operator, it's even
        worse. <code>"01" - 1 === 0, "01" - "1" === 0</code> but <code>"01" + "1" === "011", "01" + 1 === "011", </code>
      <li><code>< <= >= ></code> is custom too: <code>01 < 1 ===
      false, "01" < 1 === false</code> but <code>"01" < "1" ===
      true</code>. The first two compare (coerced) numbers, the last
      strings (lexically).
    </ul>
    <br>The same rule applies for <code>+=</code>.
</div><br>

<li> <code>- * / % & | ^ ~v << >> >>> -v ++v v++ --v v--</code><br> are restricted to
  primitive <code>numbers</code>
<small><a id="a3" href="#a">click for why?</a></small><div id="div3">Because they only
    operate on <code>numbers</code>, per definition. Relying on automatic
    coersion from other types may surprise you. Use the
    <code>Number()</code> function to type-convert explicitly, when
    you must.
    <br>Loose JS examples:
    <ul>
      <li><code>null * 2 === 0</code> but <code>undefined * 2 ===
        NaN</code>. Both cases are common sources of bugs. That they
        yield different results is interesting in itself since JS
        defines <code>null == undefined</code>.
      <li>All JS objects can have <code>valueOf</code>
      and <code>toString</code> functions. Both must return primitive
      values (but not necessarily <code>number</code>
      or <code>string</code>). The order of how these are invoked is
      not obvious: <code>"o: " + {valueOf: function() { return 3; },
      toString: function() { return "4"; }} === "o: 3"</code>. In
      practice, <code>valueOf</code> isn't used much other than for
      automatic unboxing
      of <code>Booleans</code>, <code>Numbers</code>
      and <code>Strings</code>. For the rare times when you use boxed
      types you can easily convert them to primitives explicitly. It's
      crucial that you know when you use boxed values (and limit their
      usage), since their semantics are sometimes surprising. It's
      true: <code>Boolean(new Boolean(false)) === true</code>.
    </ul>
    <br>The same rule applies for <code>-= *= /= %= &= |= ^= ~=
    <<= >>= >>>=</code>.
</div><br>

<li> That's it!<br> <code>+v !v && || ?: o[k]</code> and all other
  operators have identical semantics in restrict mode
<small><a id="a4" href="#a">click for why?</a></small><div id="div4">Because I believe they are well
    defined. <code>+v</code> (unary plus) is defined to type-convert into <code>number</code>,
    but you should consider using <code>Number(v)</code> instead. <code>!v</code> is defined to
    type-convert into <code>boolean</code>, and then inverts it. <code>&& ||
    ?:</code> compares against falsy values (so does the <code>if</code>-statement and
    others). <code>o[k]</code> (index) converts its key
    to <code>string</code>. And so on. I could have missed out on
    something that should be restricted, please let me know in that case.
    <ul>
      <li>I am considering restricting <code>typeof</code>, such
      that <code>typeof null</code> is disallowed. Let me know if you
      have an opinion on that.
    </ul>
</div><br>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Get started with restrict mode by
downloading <a href="http://jsshaper.org">JSShaper</a>,
a JS/ES source transforming framework. It includes
the <code>restricter</code> plugin, which adds checking to your
program without destroying your formatting. Run your tests on the
output of <code>restricter</code>. Since restrict mode is a proper
subset of JS, and conversely JS is a proper superset of restrict mode,
your restrict mode conforming programs works fine in any JS
engine. Only that by running your program
through <code>restricter</code> now and then, it becomes more robust.
<small><a id="a5" href="#a">click for instructions</a></small><div id="div5">
  <code>
    git clone git://github.com/olov/jsshaper.git<br>
    cd jsshaper<br>
    git submodule init<br>
    git submodule update<br>
    cd src<br>
    d8 run-restricter.js -- myfile.js # or js/node<br>
    <br>
    # then include plugins/restricter/restrict-mode.js in your project<br>
    <br>
  </code>
</div>
</p>
<p>Like ES5 strict mode, restrict mode is opt-in. Similarly, you enable
it by placing <code>"use restrict";</code> first in your program or
function. There's always the option to bail out: <code>(/*@loose*/ "1"+2+3)</code>.
</p>
<p>In fact, chances are that you are already mostly conforming to
restrict mode, except that you may use <code>str + num</code> to
perform string conversion and concatenation at the same time. You may
find that replacing that
with <code><a href="https://github.com/olov/jsshaper/blob/master/src/fmt.js">Fmt()</a></code>
or <code>String()</code> calls here and there is easy. You may also
find that restrict mode conforming programs are easier to read and
reason about.
</p>
<p>You're encouraged to <code>"use strict"; "use restrict";</code>
</p>
<h2>"I know my JS, why would I need this?"</h2>
<p>This isn't about fixing you, it's about fixing the language. Even
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=690">the</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=599914">best</a>
make mistakes due to loose semantics. If you're not convinced yet about
loose operator complexity, take a look at this implementation
of <a href="https://github.com/olov/jsshaper/blob/master/src/ecma-ops/ecma-ops.js">EcmaScript
operators in EcmaScript</a>. Also note that SpiderMonkey, JSC and V8
does not implement identical semantics. Since restrict mode is opt-in,
you may consider adding it just to a part of your program.
</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Restrict mode was created by <a href="http://lassus.se">Olov
 Lassus</a> and isn't related to the work by the ECMA committee. ES5
 strict mode was important in that it started improving the language
 by reducing it, not just adding to it. Harmony seems very focused on
 new features but will hopefully continue that tradition,
 too. Restrict mode, just like ES5 strict mode, is something you can
 start using today thanks to
 <a href="http://jsshaper.org">JSShaper</a>. It's
 technically possible, but not very likely, that a JS engine could
 add built-in support for restrict mode in the future. It
 doesn't really matter.
</p>
<p>Restrict mode is a moving target and details are likely to change
based on your <a href="http://lassus.se">feedback</a>. Thanks for
trying it out!
